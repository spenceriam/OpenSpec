# OpenSpec

OpenSpec is an open-source web application that democratizes spec-driven development by replicating Kiro IDE's Spec Mode functionality. It generates comprehensive technical specifications using any AI model from OpenRouter's API, following a structured three-phase workflow with iterative refinement capabilities.

## Setup commands

- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Start development server: `npm run dev`
- Build for production: `npm run build`
- Start production server: `npm start`
- Run linting: `npm run lint`
- Run tests: `npm test`

## Technology stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with App Router
- **UI Components**: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- **Markdown**: react-markdown for rendering
- **Diagrams**: Mermaid.js for automatic diagram generation
- **Code Editor**: Monaco Editor (if implemented)

- Include JSDoc comments for complex functions

### React/Next.js Patterns
- Use App Router conventions (app/ directory)
- Prefer Server Components where possible
- Client Components only when necessary (API calls, localStorage)
- Use React hooks appropriately (useState, useEffect, custom hooks)

### Component Structure
- Follow shadcn/ui component patterns
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Keep components focused and reusable
- Export components as named exports

### API Integration
- All OpenRouter API calls must be client-side
- Handle API errors gracefully with user feedback
- Use proper TypeScript interfaces for API responses
- Implement loading states and error boundaries

## Testing approach

- Write unit tests for utility functions
- Test React components with React Testing Library
- Mock OpenRouter API calls in tests
- Test localStorage functionality
- Use Jest for test runner
- Add integration tests for complete workflows

## Key workflows

### Spec Generation Process
1. User enters OpenRouter API key (session only)
2. User selects AI model from available options
3. User provides feature description and context files
4. Three-phase generation: Requirements → Design → Tasks
5. Each phase allows refinement before approval
6. Export capabilities for all generated specifications

### Development Workflow
- Follow semantic versioning for releases
- Use conventional commits for clear history
- Always test with actual OpenRouter API integration
- Verify localStorage warnings display correctly
- Test export functionality thoroughly

## Environment variables

No server-side environment variables needed. All configuration is client-side:
- OpenRouter API keys managed in browser memory only
- No authentication system required
- No database connections

## Build and deployment

### Local Development
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Production Build
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

### Vercel Deployment
- Connect repository to Vercel
- No environment variables needed
- Automatic deployments on main branch pushes
- Use Next.js build optimization

## Security considerations

- Never store API keys persistently
- Clear sensitive data on page unload
- Validate file uploads for supported types
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Use HTTPS for all API communications
- Follow OpenRouter API best practices

## Contribution guidelines

### Code Quality

## Debugging and Troubleshooting Tools

### Performance Summary Empty Data Issues

If the performance summary shows empty elapsed time/tokens, use these debugging approaches:

#### Browser Console Commands
```javascript
// Inspect current workflow state
JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('openspec-workflow-state') || '{}')

// Check for timing data specifically
const state = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('openspec-workflow-state') || '{}')
console.log('Timing:', state.timing)
console.log('API Responses:', state.apiResponses)

// List all OpenSpec storage keys
Object.keys(localStorage).filter(key => key.includes('openspec'))
```

#### Debug Script
```bash
# Run the debug storage script in browser console
# Copy the contents of debug-storage.js and paste in browser console
```

#### Development Testing
```javascript
// In development mode, use the test button to populate dummy data
// Look for "🧪 Add Test Performance Data" button when workflow is complete
// This will help verify that the UI display logic works correctly
```

#### Console Debug Output
Look for these console messages to track workflow state:
- `[DataMigration]` - Shows data validation and migration process
- `[AutoGen]` - Shows automatic generation completion with timing/cost data
- `[PerfSummary]` - Shows what data is available when rendering performance summary

#### Common Issues and Solutions
1. **Empty timing data**: Check if `timing` object exists and has proper structure
2. **Missing API responses**: Verify `apiResponses` object has data for completed phases
3. **Stale localStorage**: Clear localStorage and regenerate workflow to get fresh data
4. **Migration issues**: Look for `[DataMigration]` logs to see if old data is being properly migrated

### File Structure Debug
```
debug-storage.js         # Storage inspection utility
hooks/useSpecWorkflow.ts # Main workflow logic with timing/cost tracking
app/page.tsx            # Performance summary UI display logic
```

## Recent Technical Solutions

### ModelSelector State Synchronization Fix (2025-01-15)

**Problem**: React hook state isolation - multiple components using `useSimpleApiKeyStorage` had separate state instances

**Root Cause**: When `ApiKeyInput` called `setAPIKey()`, it updated sessionStorage and its own state, but other components (main page, ModelSelector) didn't re-render because their hook instances had separate state.

**Solution**: Implemented cross-hook state synchronization:
```typescript
// In setAPIKey and clearAPIKey:
window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('openspec-api-key-change'))

// In useEffect:
window.addEventListener('openspec-api-key-change', handleStorageChange)
```

**Result**: All components using `useSimpleApiKeyStorage` now stay synchronized. ModelSelector appears immediately after API key validation.

### Token Optimization Analysis (2025-01-15)

**Problem**: API calls generating 222,000-230,000 tokens, exceeding model limits (32,768 tokens)

**Phase 1 - Client-Side Optimization (Completed)**:
1. **System Prompt Reduction**: Reduced from 17,000 characters (4,250 tokens) to ~1,000 characters (150 tokens) - **98% reduction**
2. **Context File Duplication Removal**: Eliminated double-sending of context files in API payload
3. **Token Estimation Standardization**: Unified to 3.7 chars/token industry standard
4. **Enhanced Debugging**: Added comprehensive token breakdown logging
5. **Phase Separation**: Ensured Requirements → Design → Tasks phases don't concatenate content

**Phase 2 - Server-Side Protection (Implemented)**:
1. **Conservative Token Budgeting**: 32k context limit with 8k output reservation
2. **Multi-Layer Defense**: Client filtering + server clamping + binary stripping
3. **Middle-Out Truncation**: Preserves important beginning/end content
4. **Binary Content Detection**: Strips data URLs and base64 sequences
5. **Graceful Degradation**: Clear truncation indicators for users

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- **System prompts were massive**: Design prompt alone was 17,000 characters!
- **Context files sent twice**: Both embedded in userPrompt AND as separate contextFiles parameter
- **Binary content bloat**: Base64 images/PDFs inflating prompt sizes
- **Inconsistent token estimation**: Multiple methods (3.3, 4, varying ratios) caused inaccurate validation

**Technical Implementation**:
```typescript
// Server-side clamping with multiple safety mechanisms
function clampPrompts(systemPrompt, userPrompt, contextLimit = 32768, maxOutput = 8192) {
  // 1. Strip binary content (base64, data URLs)
  // 2. Calculate safe input budget (context - output - buffer)
  // 3. Apply middle-out truncation if needed
  // 4. Preserve system prompt priority
  // 5. Log all clamping activity for monitoring
}
```

**Current Status**: ✅ **COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED** - Multiple defense layers should prevent all token overflow scenarios

**Key Files Modified**:

## Maintaining This Document

This AGENTS.md file should be updated throughout the project lifecycle:

1. **After major milestones** - Update project status and file structure
2. **When adding new dependencies** - Update setup commands and tech stack
3. **When establishing new patterns** - Add to code style and conventions
4. **When encountering common issues** - Add to troubleshooting section
5. **When changing deployment** - Update build and deployment instructions

Remember: OpenSpec is a client-side only application. All AI model interactions happen through OpenRouter API, and all data is stored locally in the user's browser.
