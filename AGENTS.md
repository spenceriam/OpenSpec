# OpenSpec

OpenSpec is an open-source web application that democratizes spec-driven development by replicating Kiro IDE's Spec Mode functionality. It generates comprehensive technical specifications using any AI model from OpenRouter's API, following a structured three-phase workflow with iterative refinement capabilities.

## Setup commands

- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Start development server: `npm run dev`
- Build for production: `npm run build`
- Start production server: `npm start`
- Run linting: `npm run lint`
- Run tests: `npm test`

## Technology stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with App Router
- **UI Components**: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- **Markdown**: react-markdown for rendering
- **Diagrams**: Mermaid.js for automatic diagram generation
- **Code Editor**: Monaco Editor (if implemented)
- **API**: OpenRouter API integration
- **Storage**: Browser sessionStorage for user sessions
- **Deployment**: Vercel-optimized

## Development environment

- Node.js 18+ required
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- ESLint and Prettier for code formatting
- No backend - fully client-side application
- OpenRouter API key required for functionality

## Code style and conventions

### TypeScript Guidelines
- Use strict TypeScript configuration
- Prefer type interfaces over any
- Use proper typing for OpenRouter API responses
- Include JSDoc comments for complex functions

### React/Next.js Patterns
- Use App Router conventions (app/ directory)
- Prefer Server Components where possible
- Client Components only when necessary (API calls, localStorage)
- Use React hooks appropriately (useState, useEffect, custom hooks)

### Component Structure
- Follow shadcn/ui component patterns
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Keep components focused and reusable
- Export components as named exports

### API Integration
- All OpenRouter API calls must be client-side
- Handle API errors gracefully with user feedback
- Use proper TypeScript interfaces for API responses
- Implement loading states and error boundaries

## Testing approach

- Write unit tests for utility functions
- Test React components with React Testing Library
- Mock OpenRouter API calls in tests
- Test localStorage functionality
- Use Jest for test runner
- Add integration tests for complete workflows

## Key workflows

### Spec Generation Process
1. User enters OpenRouter API key (session only)
2. User selects AI model from available options
3. User provides feature description and context files
4. Three-phase generation: Requirements ‚Üí Design ‚Üí Tasks
5. Each phase allows refinement before approval
6. Export capabilities for all generated specifications

### Development Workflow
- Follow semantic versioning for releases
- Use conventional commits for clear history
- Always test with actual OpenRouter API integration
- Verify localStorage warnings display correctly
- Test export functionality thoroughly

## Environment variables

No server-side environment variables needed. All configuration is client-side:
- OpenRouter API keys managed in browser memory only
- No authentication system required
- No database connections

## Build and deployment

### Local Development
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Production Build
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

### Vercel Deployment
- Connect repository to Vercel
- No environment variables needed
- Automatic deployments on main branch pushes
- Use Next.js build optimization

## Security considerations

- Never store API keys persistently
- Clear sensitive data on page unload
- Validate file uploads for supported types
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Use HTTPS for all API communications
- Follow OpenRouter API best practices

## Contribution guidelines

### Code Quality
- Run `npm run lint` before committing
- Follow existing code patterns
- Add TypeScript types for new features
- Update documentation for API changes

### Commit Messages
Follow conventional commit format:
- `feat:` new features
- `fix:` bug fixes
- `docs:` documentation changes
- `style:` formatting changes
- `refactor:` code refactoring
- `test:` adding tests
- `chore:` maintenance tasks

### Pull Request Process
1. Create feature branch from main
2. Make changes following code style guidelines
3. Add tests for new functionality
4. Update documentation if needed
5. Run full test suite
6. Submit PR with clear description

## AI Model Integration

### OpenRouter API Usage
- Support all available OpenRouter models
- Handle model-specific context limits
- Implement proper error handling for API failures
- Show real-time pricing and context information
- Filter models based on capability requirements

### Prompt Engineering
- Maintain separate prompts for each phase
- Follow Kiro Spec Mode format exactly
- Include diagram generation instructions
- Handle iterative refinement requests
- Preserve context between refinement cycles

## Browser Storage

- Use sessionStorage for session persistence (data cleared when browser closed)
- Comprehensive session management with Start Over vs Continue functionality
- Auto-save during workflow for API key, model selection, prompt, and context files
- Handle storage quota limits gracefully
- Provide export options before data loss
- Security-focused: API keys masked by default, never logged to console

## Recent Technical Solutions

### ModelSelector State Synchronization Fix (2025-01-15)

**Problem**: React hook state isolation - multiple components using `useSimpleApiKeyStorage` had separate state instances

**Root Cause**: When `ApiKeyInput` called `setAPIKey()`, it updated sessionStorage and its own state, but other components (main page, ModelSelector) didn't re-render because their hook instances had separate state.

**Solution**: Implemented cross-hook state synchronization:
```typescript
// In setAPIKey and clearAPIKey:
window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('openspec-api-key-change'))

// In useEffect:
window.addEventListener('openspec-api-key-change', handleStorageChange)
```

**Result**: All components using `useSimpleApiKeyStorage` now stay synchronized. ModelSelector appears immediately after API key validation.

### Token Optimization Analysis (2025-01-15)

**Problem**: API calls generating 222,000-230,000 tokens, exceeding model limits (32,768 tokens)

**Optimization Work Completed**:
1. **System Prompt Reduction**: Reduced from 17,000 characters (4,250 tokens) to ~1,000 characters (150 tokens) - **98% reduction**
2. **Context File Duplication Removal**: Eliminated double-sending of context files in API payload
3. **Token Estimation Standardization**: Unified to 3.7 chars/token industry standard
4. **Enhanced Debugging**: Added comprehensive token breakdown logging
5. **Phase Separation**: Ensured Requirements ‚Üí Design ‚Üí Tasks phases don't concatenate content

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- **System prompts were massive**: Design prompt alone was 17,000 characters!
- **Context files sent twice**: Both embedded in userPrompt AND as separate contextFiles parameter
- **Inconsistent token estimation**: Multiple methods (3.3, 4, varying ratios) caused inaccurate validation

**Current Status**: Despite 98% system prompt reduction, still hitting 230k token limit

**Likely Remaining Issues**:
1. **buildRequirementsPrompt()** may still be concatenating excessive context file content
2. Large test content may be persisted in browser session storage and auto-loading
3. Context file processing may have bugs allowing massive individual files
4. User prompts may contain hidden content duplication we haven't identified

**Key Files Modified**:
- `lib/prompts/requirements.ts` - Reduced from 4,500 chars to 500 chars
- `lib/prompts/design.ts` - Reduced from 17,000 chars to 800 chars  
- `lib/prompts/tasks.ts` - Reduced from 6,000 chars to 1,200 chars
- `hooks/useSpecWorkflow.ts` - Added token validation, removed context file duplication

**Next Session Focus**: Character-level analysis of actual API payload content to identify remaining bloat source.

## Maintaining This Document

This AGENTS.md file should be updated throughout the project lifecycle:

1. **After major milestones** - Update project status and file structure
2. **When adding new dependencies** - Update setup commands and tech stack
3. **When establishing new patterns** - Add to code style and conventions
4. **When encountering common issues** - Add to troubleshooting section
5. **When changing deployment** - Update build and deployment instructions

Remember: OpenSpec is a client-side only application. All AI model interactions happen through OpenRouter API, and all data is stored locally in the user's browser.
