# Requirements Document

## Introduction

OpenSpec is an open-source web application that democratizes spec-driven development by replicating Kiro IDE's Spec Mode functionality. The application enables developers to generate technical specifications (requirements.md, design.md, tasks.md) using any AI model from OpenRouter's API, following Kiro's exact three-phase workflow with iterative refinement capabilities. This tool aims to make structured development planning accessible to all developers, regardless of their IDE choice.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to enter my OpenRouter API key once per session, so that I can use any AI model without setting up authentication systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user first visits the application THEN the system SHALL display an API key input field
2. WHEN the user enters a valid OpenRouter API key THEN the system SHALL store it in the browser session
3. WHEN the user refreshes the page THEN the system SHALL retain the API key for the current session
4. WHEN the user closes the browser THEN the system SHALL clear the API key from storage
5. IF the API key is invalid THEN the system SHALL display an error message and request re-entry

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to select from all available OpenRouter models with search and filtering capabilities, so that I can choose the most appropriate AI model for my specification needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user has entered a valid API key THEN the system SHALL fetch and display all available OpenRouter models
2. WHEN the user types in the model search field THEN the system SHALL filter models by name in real-time
3. WHEN the user selects a model THEN the system SHALL store the selection for the current session
4. WHEN the model list fails to load THEN the system SHALL display an error message with retry option
5. IF no models match the search criteria THEN the system SHALL display "No models found" message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to input text prompts and upload files (code, docs, images), so that I can provide comprehensive context for specification generation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses the prompt input THEN the system SHALL provide a text area for typing
2. WHEN the user clicks the file upload button THEN the system SHALL open a file picker supporting code, document, and image files
3. WHEN the user uploads a file THEN the system SHALL display the file name and allow removal
4. WHEN the user uploads an image THEN the system SHALL display a preview thumbnail
5. WHEN the user uploads a text file THEN the system SHALL show the file size and type
6. IF the file size exceeds limits THEN the system SHALL display an error and reject the upload

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to automatically generate Mermaid diagrams during the design phase based on different personas and use cases, so that I can visualize system architecture, user flows, sequences, and data relationships for various stakeholders.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the design phase generates content THEN the system SHALL automatically create relevant Mermaid diagrams based on identified personas
2. WHEN architecture is described THEN the system SHALL generate system architecture diagrams showing component relationships
3. WHEN user flows are mentioned THEN the system SHALL create user journey diagrams for each identified persona
4. WHEN data models are defined THEN the system SHALL generate ERD diagrams showing entity relationships
5. WHEN processes are described THEN the system SHALL create sequence diagrams showing interaction flows
6. WHEN different user roles are identified THEN the system SHALL generate role-specific workflow diagrams
7. IF diagram generation fails THEN the system SHALL display the raw Mermaid code as fallback

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want browser-based storage with clear warnings about data persistence, so that I understand my work is temporary and can plan accordingly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user starts working THEN the system SHALL display a prominent warning about temporary storage
2. WHEN the user creates content THEN the system SHALL automatically save to localStorage
3. WHEN the user returns to the application THEN the system SHALL restore previous work if available
4. WHEN localStorage is full THEN the system SHALL display a warning and suggest export
5. IF the user clears browser data THEN the system SHALL lose all stored specifications

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to export specifications to markdown format (individual files or combined) including all generated Mermaid diagrams, so that I can use them in my development workflow outside the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user completes any phase THEN the system SHALL enable export options for that phase including any generated diagrams
2. WHEN the user clicks "Export Individual Files" THEN the system SHALL download separate .md files with embedded Mermaid diagrams
3. WHEN the user clicks "Export Combined" THEN the system SHALL download a single .md file with all phases and diagrams
4. WHEN exporting diagrams THEN the system SHALL include both rendered images and raw Mermaid code
5. WHEN exporting THEN the system SHALL preserve all formatting, diagrams, and structure
6. WHEN diagrams exist THEN the system SHALL provide options to export diagrams as separate .mmd files
7. IF export fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and retry option

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to follow a three-phase workflow (Requirements → Design → Tasks) with approval gates, so that I can systematically develop comprehensive specifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user starts a new spec THEN the system SHALL begin with the Requirements phase
2. WHEN the Requirements phase is complete THEN the system SHALL require user approval before proceeding
3. WHEN the user approves Requirements THEN the system SHALL unlock the Design phase
4. WHEN the Design phase is complete THEN the system SHALL require user approval before proceeding
5. WHEN the user approves Design THEN the system SHALL unlock the Tasks phase
6. IF the user rejects any phase THEN the system SHALL allow iterative refinement

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want iterative refinement capabilities at each phase through user feedback, so that I can perfect my specifications before moving forward.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user provides feedback on any phase THEN the system SHALL regenerate content incorporating the feedback
2. WHEN regeneration is complete THEN the system SHALL present the updated content for review
3. WHEN the user requests specific changes THEN the system SHALL apply those changes accurately
4. WHEN multiple iterations occur THEN the system SHALL maintain version history in the session
5. IF the user wants to revert changes THEN the system SHALL allow returning to previous versions

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to generate requirements in EARS format with user stories, so that I get structured, testable requirements following industry standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating requirements THEN the system SHALL format them using EARS syntax (WHEN/IF/THEN/SHALL)
2. WHEN creating requirements THEN the system SHALL include user stories in "As a [role], I want [feature], so that [benefit]" format
3. WHEN structuring requirements THEN the system SHALL use hierarchical numbering with acceptance criteria
4. WHEN requirements are complete THEN the system SHALL ensure all functional aspects are covered
5. IF requirements are incomplete THEN the system SHALL identify gaps and suggest additions

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive design documents with architecture and diagrams, so that I have detailed technical specifications for implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating design THEN the system SHALL include Overview, Architecture, Components, Data Models, Error Handling, and Testing Strategy sections
2. WHEN creating architecture THEN the system SHALL generate corresponding Mermaid diagrams
3. WHEN defining components THEN the system SHALL specify interfaces and relationships
4. WHEN describing data models THEN the system SHALL include validation and constraints
5. IF design elements are missing THEN the system SHALL prompt for additional details

### Requirement 11

**User Story:** As a developer, I want tasks formatted as numbered checkboxes for implementation, so that I have an actionable development plan.
