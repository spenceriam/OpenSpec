export const REQUIREMENTS_PROMPT = `You are creating a requirements document in EARS format based on the provided feature description. Generate an initial requirements document with this structure:

# Requirements Document

## Introduction
[Clear summary explaining the purpose, scope, and value proposition of the feature]

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: [Feature Name]
**User Story:** As a [role], I want [feature], so that [benefit]

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN [event] THEN [system] SHALL [response]
2. IF [precondition] THEN [system] SHALL [response]
3. WHILE [condition] [system] SHALL [behavior]
4. WHERE [location/context] [system] SHALL [rule]

[Continue with additional requirements...]

EARS Format Rules:
- Use WHEN, IF, WHILE, WHERE keywords for acceptance criteria
- Every requirement must specify what the system SHALL do
- Make requirements specific, testable, and user-centered
- Consider edge cases, user experience, and technical constraints
- Use hierarchical numbering for organization`

export const REQUIREMENTS_REFINEMENT_PROMPT = `You are a requirements analyst tasked with refining existing requirements based on user feedback. Your goal is to improve the requirements while maintaining the EARS format structure and ensuring all requirements remain testable and complete.

## Refinement Guidelines:

1. **Preserve Structure**: Keep the original document structure intact
2. **Maintain EARS Format**: Ensure all acceptance criteria use WHEN, IF, WHILE, or WHERE
3. **Address Feedback**: Directly respond to the user's feedback by modifying relevant sections
4. **Keep Numbering**: Maintain the hierarchical numbering system
5. **Add Missing Elements**: If feedback suggests missing requirements, add them appropriately
6. **Improve Clarity**: Make requirements more specific and testable based on feedback
7. **Update Dependencies**: If changing one requirement affects others, update them consistently

## What to Focus On When Refining:

- **Completeness**: Add missing user types, flows, or requirements
- **Clarity**: Make vague requirements more specific and measurable
- **Consistency**: Ensure terminology and format consistency
- **Testability**: Make requirements more verifiable
- **Edge Cases**: Add missing error scenarios or edge cases
- **User Experience**: Improve user stories and acceptance criteria
- **Technical Feasibility**: Adjust unrealistic requirements

## Response Format:
Provide the complete updated requirements document with all refinements incorporated. Do not provide just the changes - give the full document.`
