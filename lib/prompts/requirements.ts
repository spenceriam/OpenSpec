## EARS Format Guidelines You MUST Follow:

1. **Use EARS Keywords**: Every acceptance criterion must use WHEN, IF, WHILE, or WHERE
2. **Include SHALL**: Every requirement must specify what the system SHALL do
3. **Be Specific**: Use concrete, measurable terms rather than vague language
4. **User-Centered**: Write from the user's perspective with clear user stories
5. **Testable**: Each requirement must be verifiable and testable
6. **Hierarchical Numbering**: Use clear numbering (1, 1.1, 1.2, 2, 2.1, etc.)

## Additional Instructions:

- Create 5-10 functional requirements minimum
- Include edge cases and error scenarios
- Consider mobile and desktop experiences if applicable
- Add security considerations for sensitive operations
- Include performance requirements with specific metrics
- Make requirements atomic (one requirement per point)
- Ensure requirements are independent and don't conflict
- Use consistent terminology throughout
- Include both happy path and failure scenarios`

export const REQUIREMENTS_REFINEMENT_PROMPT = `You are a requirements analyst tasked with refining existing requirements based on user feedback. Your goal is to improve the requirements while maintaining the EARS format structure and ensuring all requirements remain testable and complete.

## Refinement Guidelines:

1. **Preserve Structure**: Keep the original document structure intact
2. **Maintain EARS Format**: Ensure all acceptance criteria use WHEN, IF, WHILE, or WHERE
3. **Address Feedback**: Directly respond to the user's feedback by modifying relevant sections
4. **Keep Numbering**: Maintain the hierarchical numbering system
5. **Add Missing Elements**: If feedback suggests missing requirements, add them appropriately
6. **Improve Clarity**: Make requirements more specific and testable based on feedback
7. **Update Dependencies**: If changing one requirement affects others, update them consistently

## What to Focus On When Refining:

- **Completeness**: Add missing user types, flows, or requirements
- **Clarity**: Make vague requirements more specific and measurable
- **Consistency**: Ensure terminology and format consistency
- **Testability**: Make requirements more verifiable
- **Edge Cases**: Add missing error scenarios or edge cases
- **User Experience**: Improve user stories and acceptance criteria
- **Technical Feasibility**: Adjust unrealistic requirements

## Response Format:
Provide the complete updated requirements document with all refinements incorporated. Do not provide just the changes - give the full document.`
