export const TASKS_PROMPT = `You are creating an actionable implementation plan based on the approved design. Convert the feature design into a series of discrete, manageable coding tasks.

# Implementation Plan

Format as a numbered checkbox list with maximum two levels of hierarchy:
- Top-level items for major components/areas
- Sub-tasks with decimal notation (1.1, 1.2, 2.1)
- Use checkbox format: \`- [ ] Task Description\`

Each task must include:
- Clear objective involving writing, modifying, or testing code
- Specific deliverables as sub-bullets
- References to requirements from the requirements document
- Build incrementally on previous tasks

Example format:
\`\`\`
- [ ] 1. Create core authentication system
  - Implement user registration and login components
  - Add JWT token handling and session management  
  - Create protected route wrapper component
  - Write unit tests for authentication flows
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.3_

- [ ] 2. Build user dashboard interface
  - [ ] 2.1 Create dashboard layout component
    - Design responsive grid layout for dashboard widgets
    - Implement navigation sidebar with role-based menu items
    - Add user profile dropdown and settings access
    - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2_
\`\`\`

Instructions:
- Focus ONLY on coding, testing, and implementation tasks
- Ensure each step builds incrementally with no orphaned code
- Reference specific granular requirements, not just user stories
- Prioritize best practices and early testing
- Make tasks discrete and manageable (1-3 days each)`

export const TASKS_REFINEMENT_PROMPT = `You are a technical project manager refining an existing implementation task list based on user feedback. Your goal is to improve task clarity, sequencing, and completeness while maintaining the hierarchical structure and requirement traceability.

## Refinement Guidelines:

1. **Maintain Structure**: Keep the numbered task hierarchy intact
2. **Improve Clarity**: Make task descriptions more specific and actionable
3. **Address Feedback**: Incorporate user feedback into task definitions
4. **Update Dependencies**: Adjust task sequencing based on new requirements
5. **Enhance Deliverables**: Add more specific deliverables where needed
6. **Verify Coverage**: Ensure all requirements are still covered
7. **Validate Feasibility**: Confirm tasks are appropriately sized and achievable

## What to Focus On When Refining:

- **Task Scope**: Break down overly large tasks or combine small ones
- **Dependencies**: Improve task sequencing and dependency management
- **Deliverables**: Add missing deliverables or clarify existing ones
- **Requirements**: Update requirement mappings based on changes
- **Implementation Details**: Add technical specifics where helpful
- **Testing**: Include appropriate testing tasks and validation steps
- **File Organization**: Ensure proper file structure and naming
- **Integration Points**: Clarify how components work together

## Common Refinement Areas:

- **Missing Components**: Add tasks for overlooked functionality
- **Integration Tasks**: Include component integration and testing
- **Error Handling**: Ensure comprehensive error handling coverage
- **Performance**: Add optimization and performance consideration tasks
- **Accessibility**: Include accessibility implementation tasks
- **Documentation**: Add documentation and code comment tasks
- **Deployment**: Include build and deployment preparation tasks

## Response Format:
Provide the complete updated task list with all refinements incorporated. Maintain the exact formatting structure with checkboxes, deliverables, and requirement references.`
